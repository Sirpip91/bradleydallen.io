# What is Array?
Array is collection of elements of the **same** type stored in **contiguous** memory location.
* Data type: char, int, string, pair.
* Global arrays are declared with 0.
* Max array size is `10^6`
* Index starts at 0 to n-1 where n is size of array.
* Array is stored at random memory address location. Then from there it will increase +1.
* Arrays are **constant** size. Vectors are **dynamic**.

## Declaring an Array
To declare an array we use this format.
```cpp
int arr[10]; // setups an array with 10 integers.
```
All of the 10 values will be initialized with "garbage" values.
To set the values of the array at initialization time you can use this format:
```cpp
int arr[10] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10};
```
If you would like to make all of the elements start at 0 you can use this format:
```cpp
int arr[10] = {0}; //sets the first element to 0 then all rest will be 0.
```
Although you cannot use this technique for any value for all elements:
```cpp
int arr[10] = {1}; // this sets the first element to 1 then all rest will be 0.
```
This is because if you set the value of one of the elements then the compiler will not be able to use garbage values. instead it will set all of the unset values to 0. because array are continuous in memory.
This issue will be solved when we get to vectors.
## Accessing Array Elements
To access an element of an array we can use the index each element is assigned to.
Indexes start at 0 for Arrays and go to n-1.
```cpp
int arr[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
cout << arr[0]; //will output 10
cout << arr[4]; //will output 50
```
To access all of the elements of an array we can use a for loop to list every index.
```cpp
for(int i =0; i<5; i++){
	cout << arr[i] << " ";
}
//output will be 10 20 30 40 50
```
Since Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations aka in order next to each other from the start. The memory will be something like this:
Lets say the start of the array is at address 1000
- `arr[0]` → Address `1000` (for example)
- `arr[1]` → Address `1004`
- `arr[2]` → Address `1008`
- `arr[3]` → Address `1012`
- `arr[4]` → Address `1016`
Since integers take 4 bytes in most systems we can follow it in memory.

## Modifying Array Values:
To modify an array value we can first get the index to access it then change the value:
```cpp
arr[0] = 25; //this will make the value at index 0 to 25.
```
To delete a value from an array requires too much in-depth for this guide. But feel free to do your own research. I will be explaining how to do this with vectors.

## Multidimensional Arrays
A Multidimensional Array is an array of arrays. AKA matrix.
In order to simplify this explanation think of an excel spread sheet will rows and columns.
Declaring a 2D array:
```cpp
int arr[2][3]; //initalizes a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns.
// 0 0 0
// 0 0 0
```
The first set of brackets is the rows. The second set of brackets is the columns.
You can initialize the matrix with values also:
```cpp
int arr[2][3] = {
	{1,2,3},
	{4,5,6}
}; //2D array with 2 rows and 3 columns.
```
To access elements of a matrix you can specify what row and what column:
```cpp
cout << arr[0][1]; // outputs 2
cout << arr[0][0]; // outputs 1
cout << arr[2][2]; // outputs 5
```

To access all elements using loops:
```cpp
for(int i = 0; i<2; i++)//loop for the rows.
{
	for(int j = 0; j<3;j++) //loop for the columns
	{
		cout << arr[i][j]; // this  will output every value in the matrix.
	}
	cout << endl; //go to next line when we finish each row.
}
```

## Drawbacks of Arrays
* Arrays are fixed size. Meaning we cannot add or remove after setting up.
* Arrays can be access out of bounds. Meaning we have to know the end in order to loop through them.
* Not many functions built in to use for arrays. Like the issues of initializing all to a certain value.

This leads us to arrays bigger and better brother: The vector

# What is an Vector?
A vector is a dynamic array that has built in functions that allow easier use and manipulation of data. This is your bread and butter when it comes to anything regarding arrays and lists in C++.
* **Data types**: containers, int, char, short, longs double. Also structs pointers. and  pairs, tuple.
* **Vector of vector** is another way of declaring a matrix.

To be able to use a vector you must include the header:
```cpp
#include <vector>
```

## Declaring a Vector:
to declare a vector of a certain data type:
```cpp
vector<int> v; //vector of integers with name v.
vector<float> f; //vector of floats with name f.
vector<vector<int>> matrix; //vector of vectors with value int named matrix.
```
To declare a vector with size unknown or 0:
```cpp
vector<int> v;
```
If we know the size of the vector we want to create we can define it: 
```cpp
vector<int> v(5); //this declares a vector with 5 elements. all initialized at 0
```
To fix the issue of not being able to declare with specific values we can now use this:
```cpp
vector<int> v(5,10); // all 5 values will be declared with integer 10
```
We can still use the Array technique of initializing the values at declaration:
```cpp
vector<int> v = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}; //vector of size 10 with those values.
```

If you would like to copy vector from another. aka making a duplicate you can just pass the vector in while declaring it:
```cpp
vector<int> v1(5,10); //vector v1 with 5 elements all set to 10.

vector<int> v2(v1); //vector v2 with the same 5 elements all set to 10 like v1.
```
## Adding Elements
To add elements to a  we can simply just use 
```cpp
v.push_back(10); //this will add the value 10 to the end of the vector.
```
We can also use emplace. 
```cpp
v.emplace_back(10); //this will add the value 10 to the end of the vector.
```
Generally just use `.push_back() ` when adding elements to a vector. There are a few differences but if you would like to go down that rabbit whole please research on your own. `.emplace_back()` is not used as much but is supposed to be faster. The main difference is how the function uses the objects constructor arguments.

If you have a vector of pairs you can also use `.push_back()`. 
```cpp
vector<pair<int,int>> vpair; //create a vector of integer pairs.

vpair.push_back({1,2}); //This will add the pair{1,2} to the vector.

vpair.emplace_back(1,2); //this will add pair {1,2} to the vector. Notice we do not have to add the pair curly brace syntax. This is one of the key differences with emplace_back.
```
## Accessing Elements
We can access elements of a vector the same way that we access elements in arrays:
```cpp
cout << v[0]; //this will output the 0th index value.
```
If you would like to get fancy and use the built in function:
```cpp
cout << v.at(0) // this will output the 0th index value. But nobody does this. very uncommon.
```
You can still access the elements like arrays even with for loops. try it yourself.
# Vector  Iterators
This is the most important part of this guide that you must understand. Please do not move forward until you understand and can use iterators as they will be used in many other data structures.
## What is an Iterator
An iterator is a pointer or "thing" that points to the memory address of a container, in this case a vector.

We can use iterator to traverse the memory of any container. Then getting the value at any memory point. 

### First we need to get the memory address for the iterator
There are built in functions that return the beginning address and ending address of a vector:
```cpp
v.begin(); //this returns the memory address of the beginning of the vector v
v.end(); //this returns the memory address of the end of the vector v.

//* note that .end() will not be pointing at the last element, but one after it.
```
Please memorize these two functions as they are used a lot.
Now that we have the two memory addresses we can get their value using a pointer.

### Quick recap of pointers
```cpp
vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

int start = *v.begin(); // this will return the value at memory location v.begin()

cout << start; //this will output 1
```
## Value *
When you see the star or asterisk symbol think **value**! 
The start is used to access the value that the pointer is pointing too in memory.

Example of getting value of a pointer:
```cpp
int x = 10;
int* ptr = &x; // ptr points to x's memory location
cout << *ptr;  // Dereferences ptr, prints the value of x (10)
```
## Reference &
When you see the and  symbol think **memory**!
There are many cases where you pass a vector by reference in a function.
Example:
```cpp
vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
	//notice the & nums.
	//the vector nums is being referenced.
	//we are not using a duplicate, but the original nums vector in the function.
}
```
Now that we understand pointers and memory we can now upgrade to iterators.
### Declaring an Iterator
The textbook way of setting up an iterator can be done:
```cpp
vector<int>::iterator it = v.begin(); //we create a iterator named it and make it start at v.begin();
```
We use iterators to traverse the vectors. Here is an example loop to go through all values of vector:
```cpp
for(vector<int>::iterator it = v.begin(); it!= v.end(); it++){
	cout << *(it) << " ";
}
```
This is very confusing and has a lot of extra information. Let's shorten this:
```cpp
for(auto it = v.begin(); it!=v.end(); it++){
	cout << *(it) << " ";
}
```
Notice how we used the word '**auto**'. This will automatically determine what is the datatype we are iterating over. This is a very default way of traversing over a vector using iterator.

Now the **most common way** of iterating over some vector or container is the for each loop:
```cpp
for(auto it: v){
	cout << it << " "; //this will output the value of each index of v.
}
```
This is the most common and easiest way to traverse over a vector and get the values. The auto keyword will be whatever the data type is in the container. So for example if they are all integers then the it will print the integers in the vector v.
# Vector Deletion
In order to delete an element in a vector you have to use the `.erase()` function:
```cpp
vector<int> v = {1,2,3,4,5};
v.erase(v.begin()); //this will erase the element at index 0
//{2,3,4,5}
```
Notice how we have to use the iterator `.begin()` in order to get the index we want. We are not able to use `v.erase(0)`. This is because we must use iterators with these functions.

If you would like to specify a particular index you can start from `.begin()`:
```cpp
vector<int> v = {1,2,3,4,5};
v.erase(v.begin()+2); //this will erase the element at index 2;
//{1,2,4,5}
```

If you would like to delete a group of elements you just need to specify the `.erase(start,end)` Note we start from index 0.
```cpp
vector<int> v = {1,2,3,4,5};
v.erase(v.begin() + 1, v.begin() + 4); // Erases elements from index 1 to 3 (2, 3, 4)
//{1,5}
```
# Vector Insertion
In order to insert values into the vector at specific index locations you can use the `.insert()` function.
```cpp
vector<int> v = {1,2,3,4,5};
v.insert(v.begin(), 11); //inserts 11 at the .begin() location. aka index 0
//v = {11,1,2,3,4,5}
```

To insert more than one value inside a specific index location: specify the `(start,count,value);`
```cpp
vector<int> v = {1,2,3,4,5};
v.insert(v.begin()+1, 4, 11); //insert (index 1, 4 counts, of value 11);
//{1,11,11,11,11,2,3,4,5}
```
Inserting another vector inside of a vector:
```cpp
vector<int> v2 = {7,7,7};
vector<int> v = {1,2,3,4,5};
//we want to insert v2 inside of v: starting after the 2
v.insert(v.begin()+2, v2.begin(),v2.end());
//v1 = {1,2,7,7,7,3,4,5}
```
Now you see how important understanding iterators are!

# Most Used Vector Functions
The most important functions are the ones that are used almost every time you are working with vectors. Please remember and fully understand these as skipping over will leave knowledge gaps making you go back over and over to understand this.
### `.size()`
```cpp
vector<int> v = {1,2,3,4,5};
cout << v.size(); // will give the size of the vector, starting from 1
//outputs 5
```
### `.empty()`
```cpp
vector<int> v = {1,2,3,4,5};
cout << v.empty(); //will return if the vector is empty or not.
//outputs false;
```
### `.pop_back()`
```cpp
vector<int> v = {1,2,3,4,5};
v.pop_back(); // will remove the last element
// v = {1,2,3,4,}

//if you would like to remove the first element use v.erase(v.begin())
```
### `.end()`
This function is used with other containers such as `unordered_map`. Most time functions will return .end() = true if something was not found or nothing was returned.
```cpp
vector<int> v = {1,2,3,4,5};
//we can use v.end() to locate the end of the vector.
for (auto it = v.begin(); it != v.end(); ++it) { 
cout << *it << " "; // Output: 1 2 3 4 5 
}
```
# Vector in Action:
Here is the problem 2sum from [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/).
```cpp
vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
	vector<int> v; //answer vector
	int n = nums.size(); //get the size of the vector
	
	for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
		for(int j = 1; j<n; j++){
			if(nums[i] + nums[j] == target){
				v.push_back(i); //add element 1
				v.push_back(j); //add element 2
				return v;
			}
		}
	}
	retrurn v; //return the empty vector if nothing.
}
```
We used the brute force solution to solve this problem using vectors. Notice how the nums vector is passed by reference using the &. This means we are accessing the original nums vector. We use `.size()` to get the size of the vector in order to use it in the loop. We then add the two elements for the answer using `.push_back()`

# Whats Next?
Practice these problems in order to get familiar with vectors and arrays for interview questions. If you are more development focused please build some applications! This will help you internalize this information.

Keep on the look out for the next guide on `Vector Algorithms: Unlocking the Power of C++ STL`.

I will be going over most used algorithms and manipulation for vectors such as subsets, sorting, searching.
