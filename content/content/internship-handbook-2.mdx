First we need to go over the mindset that is needed in order to succeed in this endeavor. There are a couple of questions that is needed to be answered before you begin on this internship journey.

If they are overlooked and not answered then you will falter when things get hard and uncertain.



Below are a list of five questions. Write these answers on a paper or notebook and keep referring to them. 
Really sit down, understand and answer each of these questions.



# Why Do You Want an Internship?
Before starting your internship search, the first question you need to ask yourself is: 
<Quote type="warning">
"Why do I want an internship?"
</Quote>
Answering this question will give you clarity and help you stay focused during your search.

### Your reason might be driven by various motivations, such as:

**Money**: Are you looking for financial gain or compensation?

**Experience**: Do you want to build your skills and knowledge in a real-world environment?

**Recognition**: Are you aiming to stand out in your field or industry?

**Career Opportunities**: Are you seeking to secure a future job or make your job search easier down the road?

**Full-time Conversion**: Is your goal to turn an internship into a full-time position?

Understanding why you want an internship is essential—it will shape your approach and influence your decisions throughout the process. 
This will help decide the type of internship you will acquire and the type of result you will get.


Don’t skip this important step.



## What Type of Internship Do You Want?

Knowing the type of internship you’re looking for will help you avoid choosing a position that doesn’t align with your goals. There are many different types of internships, and understanding which one suits you best will save you time, effort, and potential regret.

### Consider whether you prefer:

**Laid-back internships**: These are low-pressure positions where your tasks may be simple, such as shadowing or running errands. Ideal if you’re just getting a feel for the industry.

**Hands-on, responsibility-driven internships**: In these internships, you’ll take on real projects, learn practical skills, and be held accountable for results. This is perfect if you’re eager for a challenge and want to grow quickly.

**Reputation-building internships**: If you’re aiming to bolster your resume, you might target highly prestigious companies like FAANG (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google). Internships at these companies are often competitive but can significantly enhance your career prospects by associating you with well-known brands.

**Career-focused internships**: These internships are designed to lead directly into full-time job opportunities. You’ll want this type if your ultimate goal is a full-time offer after graduation.

**Exploratory internships**: These positions are great if you’re unsure about your career path and want to explore different areas within an industry without committing long-term.

**Non-profit or cause-driven internships**: If making a social impact is important to you, consider working for a non-profit or charity where you can contribute to meaningful causes.
Defining what kind of internship you want will make your search more focused and help ensure a fulfilling experience.

**Growth-oriented internships**: These positions are structured with the potential for advancement. You’ll start with basic tasks but, through hard work and proven results, you can gain more responsibilities and increase your chances of receiving a return offer for a full-time position. Many companies offer such internships with the goal of evaluating interns for long-term roles.

# When Do You Want to Acquire This Internship?
<Quote type="warning"> 
"When do I want to acquire this internship?"

Having a deadline and timeline is crucial for internship success. Choose a specific time frame for when you need to secure your internship. Not only will this allow you to prepare, apply, and pursue opportunities ahead of time, but it will also help you gauge how hard you need to push.

### Consider the following:
Internships typically fall into specific seasons, each requiring different timelines for applying and interviewing:

**Summer internships**: Often the most popular, these positions usually require applications as early as the fall of the previous year. Preparing early is key.

**Fall internships**: These often start in September or October, so you’ll want to apply during the summer months.

**Winter internships**: These may be less common but are often offered in December or January. Timing is critical as companies may seek interns for short-term projects.

**Spring internships**: Similar to fall internships, these typically start in late winter or early spring, necessitating applications in the previous months.

Knowing when you want to secure your internship will help you organize your schedule, balancing school and possibly part-time work, to set yourself up for success.


## Where Do You Want This Internship to Be Held?
<Quote type="warning">

Specifying where you are willing to go for this internship is a significant factor in the number of opportunities available to you.

### Consider your preferences:
**Local internships**: Are you only looking for positions within your city or region? This option may limit your opportunities but can offer convenience and the chance to build a local network.

**Willing to relocate**: Are you open to moving to a different city or state for an internship? This can expand your options and may lead to exciting opportunities in areas with thriving industries.

**Remote internships**: Are you looking for fully remote positions? This option can provide flexibility and access to companies worldwide, allowing you to apply without geographical constraints.

Increasing your search space can enhance your chances of landing an internship, while a more restricted search area may require a more strategic approach to securing a position. Be clear about your location preferences to focus your efforts effectively.

By following these steps and maintaining your determination, you can secure an internship that aligns with your goals. 

The internship will depend on your willingness to search, prepare, and improve throughout the process.

Feel free to add your personal touches. Remember, removing key steps may affect your overall success—just as omitting ingredients can alter the flavor of a soup.

## Belief
Lastly, you must believe that you can acquire an internship. This belief means being willing to **work hard** and having **persistence** to achieve your goal. 

It won’t be easy to study and apply to **hundreds** of positions without receiving a single response. 
However, 
<Quote type="warning">
Remember that it only takes **one offer** to change your entire situation.

You will be competing against many other students also seeking internships.

I personally went through three not-so-great internships before I landed a Software Developer internship at Amazon paying $52hr.

Each of those experiences provided valuable lessons that helped me improve and refine my approach. 
That is what I will be sharing with you in this handbook.

Keep your spirits high and maintain your faith, as you will need it not only to secure the internship but also to thrive during it.


Keep your encouragement and have faith, because you will need it not only for acquiring the internship, but for maintaining it.
