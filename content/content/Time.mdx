# Time Involves Itself With Everything

No matter where a person is born, how they are raised, or what their ideas are, 
one thing that they all share is the relation to time. Once a person realizes or even gives the "time"
of day to think about this idea of time I believe something in thier mind awakens.

The actual concept of time is very confusing and simple at the same time. I will explain my
idea of though of time in hopes to share my concept of time and ease the negative thoughts that
come with it.

# Do You Actually Have Time?

One thing that I hear many people say is that they either have or do not have time. I do not believe 
anyone has time. No one can acquire more time nor lose it. As soon a person comes into this world the
expiration is inevitable. To aquire more time would be to extend the experation date. The only way to 
maybe increase or decrease this is by health. Although I do not believe this is what is implied when others
say they do not have time.

I'm sure that when a person says they wish they had more time, I think they are implying that they did the 
the things that they wanted more. Meaning, they spent their "time" doing and being a person that achieves 
the actions that they wanted during their "moments" they have to spend.


### "Everybody has the same amount of time during the day"


I see this quote everywhere and what sticks out to me is that no one has more or less time than anyone else
in the world. Taking this further, what is the difference between those who do not want more time and those that do?
It comes down to whether or not a person regrets what they have done or not have done.

# Measurement of Time

When researching the measurement of time there is not a universally agreed on rule. Some believe that time is a illusion,
 other's believe that time is an actually unit. We all know of the clock and that is what many of us use to 
 keep "track" of our time. Before the clock there was the idea of the sun and moon as keeping track of "time". Then the upgrade
 came to and the water clock was used. Which then lead us to the mechanical clock.

# How to Live With Time

To accept that time will never go away and everyone comes into the world with an experation date, one must come to terms with 
this universal truth. I had my troubles with this truth when I was young, but did not run from it. One must not run from the fact that 
it is not about the sheer amount of time that one has, but the quality of the time that we do have. 

## To move forward with this idea of time we must first ask ourself's: 
<Quote type = "warning">
what is worth our time?
</Quote>

If one can answer this question then the world opens up unto them. No longer will there be regret of spending time with things or 
people that are not worth the small amount of time that we have in this plane. This will beg the questions of:

<ul>
    <li>Why do you do things?</li>
    <li>What am I doing?</li>
    <li>Where am I going?</li>
    <li>What do I want to accomplish?</li>
</ul>

These questions are very powerfull to the mind. Once the questions are read and tried to answer, the truth will start to come out.
They will show whether or not a person has been running from them, or if they are sound in thier thoughts.
These questions will also reveal what to focus on or the steps to move forward in their life.

# Currency in Relation to Time
Some may be thinking about time in regards to the dollar amount. When I was young I wanted to not "waste" my time by always working.
At one time I had two jobs in order to maximize the amount of effeciency of my time.

Later I realized that there are some people that do not trade their time for money. There is someone out there making a couple of dollars
an hour without having to put in effort or time at that moment. There is this idea of putting upfront a bit of time in order to not have to 
spend the time later.

I have tested this idea with the use of "college" or "schooling". For some reason I am given more currency for the time I have spent learning
computer science topics, because someone else did not want to. I beleive if one learns this concept early on in thier life they will accumulate 
more money in a shorter amount of time in their life.

The best part is that you can learn and spend your time on things that you can enjoy and be paid in return. This is where skills and careers come from.
I hope that everyone gets this sort of idea in their mind, because it will allow them to seek what they want and do what they wish, because if they 
do so well enough they can get paid in return with currency.

# The "me" in Time
At the end of the day each and every person has the power to decide what their time will be spent doing. This should bring satisfaction within
a person. Each person is the sum thoughts and actions that they have spent their past time on. For example the programmer only gets more of 
a programmer, the bodybuilder only gets more of a bodybuilder. The wizard only becomes more of a wizard! 

The change happens when they spend "time" on other things and actions, which
will then lead to thier future changing thus changing thier mind and body into whatever they choose. Do not waste the little currency of time 
on things in which YOU do not want to. The best part is you decide what is "Wastefull" and what is not. Do not let anyone or anybody tell you otherwise
because if you do, you are letting them use your currency of time.
