# Introduction
Recursion is a powerful technique in computer science, where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. While it may seem complex at first, mastering recursion is crucial for tackling many coding interview problems. In this guide, we will explore the key concepts, common patterns, and problem-solving strategies related to recursion that will help you excel in your interviews.

# What is Recursion?
Recursion occurs when a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a smaller version of the original problem. The key to recursion is identifying a base case, which stops the recursion, and a recursive case, which breaks the problem down into smaller subproblems.

Simple recursion example:
Take the example code to print numbers 1 to 3:

```cpp
void print_numbers(int n) {
    //base case
    if (n > 0) {
        print_numbers(n - 1); //resursive call.
        std::cout << n << " "; //print on decsending
    }
}
//calling the function with 3
print_numbers(3);
```
# Key Concepts in Recursion
1. Base Case: The condition under which the recursion stops. Without a base case, the recursion would run indefinitely.
2. Recursive Case: The part of the function that breaks the problem down into smaller instances and calls itself.
3. Stack Overflow: A common issue in recursion where too many recursive calls lead to exceeding the stack's limit.

## Phases of Recursion

There are two phases of recursion the Ascending phase and the Descending phase.

### Ascending phase

```less (4)
print_numbers(3)
   |
   |-- print_numbers(2)
   |   |
   |   |-- print_numbers(1)
   |       |
   |       |-- print_numbers(0)  -> base case (does nothing, starts return)
```
### Descending phase

```less
returning from print_numbers(0)
   |
   |-- print_numbers(1) -> std::cout << 1 << " ";
   |
   |-- print_numbers(2) -> std::cout << 2 << " ";
   |
   |-- print_numbers(3) -> std::cout << 3 << " ";

```

This will have the output of : 1 2 3.



## Recursion Variables

Static Variables inside of recursive function will not be created on each recursive call.
They will act as normal variables and can be changed/updated normally.
Think of Static variables as gloabl varaiables as they act the same.
Every recurisve call will use the same variable.

# Forms of Recursion

## Tail Recursion
If the recursive call is the last in the function it is tail recursion. All actions 
done are at Ascending time. There are no decsending actions with the recursion.

Here is an example of Tail Recursion printing values:

```cpp {5}
void print_numbers(int n) {
    //base case
    if (n > 0) {
        std::cout << n << " "; //print before recursive call
        print_numbers(n - 1); // tail recursive call.
    }
}
```

Now if you have ANY returning /decsending actions it will no longer be tail recursive
In most cases if you are writing a tail recursive function you might as well just make a loop.

## Head Recursion
If the recursion call is at the start of a function then it will be a head recursive call.
All the action will be at the Descending call. There will be no calling time actions.

Here is an example of a head recursion:

```cpp {4}
void print_numbers(int n) {
    //base case
    if (n > 0) {
        print_numbers(n - 1); //head resursive call.
        std::cout << n << " "; //print on decsending
    }
}
```

## Linear Recursion

If there are actions before and after the recursive call then it will simply be a 
linear recursion aka a mix between tail and head.

## Tree Recursion
Tree Recursion is where the recursive function will have multiple recursive calls.
Many times this will be usefull for:
```mdx ()
Binary Tree:
      1
     / \
    2   3
   / \
  4   5
```

In-Order Traversal: 4, 2, 5, 1, 3
```cpp () showLineNumbers
    void inOrder(TreeNode* root, vector<int>&v)
    {
        //base case if no root return.
        if(!root)
            return;
        //left
        inOrder(root->left,v);
        //root
        v.push_back(root->val);
        //right
        inOrder(root->right, v);
    }
```


Pre-Order Traversal: 1, 2, 4, 5, 3
```cpp () showLineNumbers
    void preOrder(TreeNode* root, vector<int>&v)
    {
        //base case if no root return.
        if(!root)
            return;
        //root
        v.push_back(root->val);
        //left
        preOrder(root->left,v);
        //right
        preOrder(root->right, v);
    }
```

Post-Order Traversal: 4, 5, 2, 3, 1
```cpp () showLineNumbers
    void postOrder(TreeNode* root, vector<int>&v)
    {
        //base case if no root return.
        if(!root)
            return;
        //left
        postOrder(root->left,v);
        //right
        postOrder(root->right, v);
        //root
        v.push_back(root->val);
    }
```

## Indirect Recursion
Indirect Recursion is where the recursive function calls ANOTHER recursive function.
This is very specific recursion that is not used much. If you would like to understand
and learn more please do your own research.

Nuntheless here is ana example:
```cpp {4}{10}
void functionA(int n) {
    if (n > 0) {
        std::cout << "In functionA: " << n << std::endl;
        functionB(n - 1);  // Call functionB
    }
}
void functionB(int n) {
    if (n > 0) {
        std::cout << "In functionB: " << n << std::endl;
        functionA(n / 2);  // Call functionA
    }
}
int main() {
    functionA(10);  // Start the recursion with functionA
    return 0;
}

```
## Nested Recursion
This is where the recursive call has another recursive function inside of it.


# Must Know Recursive problems

## Factorial of a Number:

The factorial of a number is the numbers leading up to n times it'self.
For example  n = 4 

4! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * = 24

```cpp (4) showLineNumbers
int factorial(int n )
{
    if(n==0) // base case
        return(1);
    else
        return factorial(n-1) * n; //recursive call
}
```

## Finding the Power of a Number:

```cpp (4) showLineNumbers
int power(int m, int n )
{
    if(n == 0) //base case
        return(1);
    else
        return power(m, n-1) * m; //recursive call
}
```
Improving this function further by checking if even(this may be a follow up):
```cpp (4) showLineNumbers
int power(int m, int n )
{
    if(n == 0) //base case
        return(1);
    if(n % 2 == 0)  //additional check for evens
        return power(m*m,n/2); //recursive call for evens
    else
        return m * power(m*m,(n-1)/2); //recursive call for odds
}
```

## Fibonacci Series
Every number is created by adding the previous 2 numbers.
Most problems will ask this in recursive and itterative.
```cpp (4) showLineNumbers
//O(2^n)
int fibonacci(int n )
{
    if(n<=1) //base case
        return n;
    return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1); //recursive call
}
```

## Tower Of Hanoi

[Tower of Hanoi](img/ptsd.png)
is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves moving a set of disks from one peg to another, 
following specific rules.

```cpp (4) showLineNumbers
void tower(int n,int A,int B,int C)
{
 if(n>0)
 {
 tower(n-1,A,C,B);
 printf("(%d,%d)\n",A,C);
 tower(n-1,B,A,C);
 }
}
```

## Determine Number of islands
This Technique can be used for many other problems that require checking each side of 
a matrix.
``` cpp () showLineNumbers
    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        int count = 0;
        //traverse the entire grid;
        for(int i =0;i<grid.size();i++)
        {
            for(int j = 0; j<grid[i].size(); j++)
            {
                //if we find and island find entire thing.
                if(grid[i][j] == '1')
                {
                    number(grid,i,j);
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    void number(vector<vector<char>>& grid, int i, int j)
    {
        //out of bounds then return.
        if(i<0 || j < 0 || i >=grid.size() || j >=grid[0].size())
        return;
        //if we find water '0' then return.
        if(grid[i][j] == '0')
        return;
        //set curr to water so we dont cycle
        grid[i][j] = '0';     
        //Recursive Call to each neighbor top left bottom right 
        number(grid,i+1,j);
        number(grid,i-1,j);
        number(grid,i,j+1);
        number(grid,i,j-1);
    }
```
