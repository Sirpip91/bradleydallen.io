        <h1 id="value-of-productive">Value of Productivity</h1>
        <p>Throughout my entire life I have seen many people and figures
        hold highly the idea of being productive. There seems to be a
        invisible expectation that whatever you are doing in the moment
        should be productive; Otherwise if it is not productive then you
        lose any credibility to what you are doing. This idea of being
        productive goes beyond the value of return of money. For example
        if there is one person that could be just enjoying the moment
        sitting down just thinking “not doing anything”. I’m sure there
        will be others that will have a problem or it will raise a
        question that they are wasting time.</p>
        <p>The value of productivity in the majority of people minds
        goes beyond monetary value. It seems that if you are not filling
        your time 100% of your waking hour than you are deemed as a time
        waster, or lazy. There is this mental mindset of the majority of
        people either on Youtube or in real life that you must be doing
        something with your time regardless if your mind and body is
        telling you to actually do nothing.</p>

        <div class="callout">
        “Only a slave quantifies its existence through
        productivity.”
        <div class="author">― Jett Franzen, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiNsfLuKJC0" target="_blank">On Youtube</a></em></div>
        </div>
        
        <h1 id="the-illusion-of-staying-productive">The Illusion of
        “Staying Productive”</h1>
        <p>We then move towards the idea of filling all of your time to
        be productive. “No minute is wasted if I’m doing things
        right!?!?”. This idea of always having something “to do” during
        the day is usually correlated with being productive. I’m here to
        acknowledge the idea that even though you are not doing anything
        in the present moment this does not mean that there is no reason
        to be doing something. Just because an action or thing is not
        considered “productive” does not mean that it is not worth doing
        or entertaining. Although many will say that as long as you are
        doing something no matter what it is better than doing
        nothing.</p>
        <p>This idea of always filling your mind and body with something
        seems to try and guilt-trip individuals into always having
        something to do. This illusion of “as long as I’m doing
        something I can then justify to others why I’m doing it”. This
        “Justifying or Rationalizing” becomes more of importance than
        that actual thing or action that you are doing.</p>
        <h1 id="productivity-that-silences-the-soul">Productivity That
        Silences the Soul</h1>
        <p>If you always are filling your mind and soul with things of
        action and <strong>never</strong> really thinking
        <strong>why</strong> am I doing this or only to justify to
        others, then you will run out of space for yourself and things
        that matter. I believe that a person <strong>must save space in
        their mind</strong> for personal reasons and have their own
        reasoning for everything. This idea of the mind being filled
        with junk, trash, crowded and having no room for anything else.
        How can a person have time to think, reason, and figure out ways
        to improve and “actually” be productive if they have no space? 
        <p></p>
        I believe this is what the world wants to happen. If you’re
        constantly filling every spare moment, whether it’s scrolling
        social media, playing video games, studying, or exercising, but
        never stopping to think or reason, you’re just avoiding the
        things that actually matter.</p>

        <h1 id="misery-loves-company">Misery Loves Company</h1>
        <p>
        The majority of
        the world will never care or lift you up. I believe that there
        are few that are actual allies in the world of man. Everyone
        want to have their own and be better than the next. Therefore do
        not be surprised when another slave will not want you to exit
        the bucket. The bucket of life is very serious and although one
        can get to the top of the bucket if they really wanted to, they
        will have to pass through many crabs and get pinched many
        times.
        </p>
        <p>Although the pinching may not be physical, there are mental
        manipulations that humans play against each other. Humans play a
        mental game since that is what makes the majority of humans
        different than other animals. Once the pecking order has been
        establish it is very difficult to convince or change another
        persons view on you. The way you go in is the way you come out
        in all aspects of life. 
        
        <h1>Human Beings</h1>
        Humans are meant to “be” in this world. There should be no justification to what a human
        does to “be”. Whether it be sitting and contemplating life, or
        working endlessly to accomplish a goal. The only thing that
        humans should take heed to is God. Other humans should and do
        not have any dominion over another. The foolery is when a human
        is able to manipulate and control another. That is when the
        productive slave can be created. 
        <p></p>
        The mind is the only thing that
        can shield and control against every issue or attack in this
        world and if it is filled with a bunch of
        <strong>nothing</strong> then it will be <strong>hard to use
        it</strong>. Remember this when going through life as it has
        saved me against many evils.</p>
